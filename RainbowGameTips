Here are some **tips** for the Rainbow Game
don't try to finsih your own colors first (the whole point of the game is to finish  so that everyone has their own colors 
even if you give them up, you'll get them back
be efficient
never leave an empty hand empty for too long
start with the first color, in this instance red, and work your way down the line
